    <p class="st">Humans can be defined in various ways, and I can talk a lot about why humans are different from animals,
      but to put it simply, humans are a species defined by DNA information.
      One of the biggest factors that separate humans from other species is what I consider "story" or "definition."
      Storytelling is a medium that communicates and understands my emotions and situations through storytelling,
      and effectively conveys the information necessary for survival. Just like our mother who
      scared us with scary fairy tales instead of nagging us to not go out at night when we were young.
      <br /><br />
      When I write Christmas cards to friends and family at the end of this year,
      I often write things like "You are such a good friend." Because that was my relationship with them that defined me.
      <br /><br />
      Then suddenly, I wanted to ask how my year was, how I spent this year with myself.
      I wanted to ask myself whether I was a good person, a bad person, useful, or happy,
      and I wanted to give others the opportunity to ask those questions through this project.
      <br /><br />
      Starting with this question, you can ask the best 10 minutes of your life, the moments that changed your life,
      and if your life is a movie, what is the climax of the movie?
      <br /><br />
      Even if it's a very insignificant and small moment for someone, it can be a very big turning point in life for someone else.
      The very small question of “Who am I” can be more profound and profound than you think,
      but I hope that defining it once will be a meaningful moment for you.
      <br /><br />
      So let me ask, who are you, what kind of person was "yourself" to you.
